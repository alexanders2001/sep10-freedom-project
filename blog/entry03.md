## Brainstormed
When i was brainstorming plan B i was thinking about people and how easy it is for people to get these hardware as items can be really expensive. i tried to go around an affordable price for people. Sadly lots of writing hardware is very expenisve ranging around 79-300 which is a lot for some people.However some of the items are 150 dollars which is a better deal then others. these items being the <a href=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/byok/byok-the-ultimate-distraction-free-writing-tool> BYOK. </a> which has a price around 150-170 dollars. One of the more cheaper options.
