<h1>Choosing a topic</h1>
<h2>Writing</h2><p>The topic i choose to write about was writing over the decades. This is because of our history with writing. Writing has been around for hundreds and hundreds of years. Wrting was developed in many cultures with it <a href=https://www.forkingpaths.co/p/did-humans-start-writing-10000-yearsstarting">around 3400â€“3100 BCE</a>.Writing back then were more like drawing of stuff like bulls,mammoths, and more. This was bassicly there way of writing. Wrting has been developed over the years with it starting from rocks to it now being able to be sent through around the world with the introduction of smart devices.</p>
<h2>CHAT GPT</h2><p>A constant problem thats been going around for a while is the increase use of ai websites.It has constantly been growing as a problem. with my website i hope to direct people away from using AI and doing it themselves.</p>
<h2>skills</h2>while working on this blog is not getting distracted.
<h3>Other ideas</h3> <p>I did have some other ideas on what else i wanted to do. One of those ideas were about metamorphosis. This is because of how cool the idea is of an animal being able to transform into a different type of creature. The way how some animals and insects just go to sleep and then wake up into a different creature is so cool. </p>
